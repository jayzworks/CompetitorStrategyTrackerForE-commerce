Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation),"I recently upgraded to the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation), and I am beyond thrilled with the exceptional experience they deliver. These earbuds have not only met but exceeded my expectations in every aspect.

Audio Quality:
The audio quality is nothing short of spectacular. The dynamic range, clarity, and immersive soundstage elevate my music, podcasts, and calls to a whole new level. The active noise cancellation is a game-changer, effortlessly blocking out external noise and immersing me in the audio experience.

Comfort and Fit:
The design of the AirPods Pro is a testament to Apple's commitment to user comfort. The in-ear design with customizable silicone tips ensures a snug and secure fit, making them perfect for extended use. Whether I'm working out, commuting, or simply relaxing, they stay in place without causing any discomfort.

Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode:
The active noise cancellation is incredibly effective, creating a serene listening environment even in bustling surroundings. On the flip side, the Transparency Mode is a genius addition, allowing me to stay aware of my surroundings without removing the earbuds. It's like having control over my auditory environment.

Build Quality and Design:
As expected from Apple, the build quality is impeccable. The sleek and compact charging case is not only aesthetically pleasing but also practical for on-the-go use. The touch controls on the earbuds are responsive and intuitive, adding to the overall user-friendly design.

Battery Life:
The battery life is impressive. With the case providing multiple charges, I rarely find myself needing to plug them in. The quick charge feature is a lifesaver, giving me hours of use with just a short charge.

Integration with Apple Ecosystem:
The seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem is a standout feature. From automatic device pairing to Siri integration, the AirPods Pro seamlessly integrate with my iPhone, iPad, and Mac, enhancing the overall user experience.

In conclusion, the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) are a masterpiece of audio technology. They combine unparalleled sound quality, comfort, and advanced features in a sleek and sophisticated package. While they may be an investment, the enhanced listening experience and convenience make them worth every penny. I wholeheartedly recommend the AirPods Pro to anyone in search of the ultimate wireless earbud experience.

Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation),"Finally got my hands on the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) and I'm happy that the product is 100% genuine. The sound quality and immersive audio experience have truly impressed me. The Noise Cancellation feature surpasses any other competitor in the market (obviously), and it stays snugly in my ear even during intense workouts at the gym.

All in all, I'm quite satisfied with the product (so far). The only minor drawback I'd say is that the audio bass could be a bit stronger. Still, the audio quality, the features, the battery life, and the overall fit make it a perfect travel companion.

Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation),"As an avid music lover and tech enthusiast, I recently had the opportunity to test the AirPods Pro, and I must say, they exceeded my expectations in every way possible. Apple's flagship wireless earbuds have truly set a new standard for premium audio and convenience.

Design and Comfort:
The first thing that caught my attention was the sleek and compact design of the AirPods Pro. The in-ear form factor with customizable silicone tips ensures a secure and comfortable fit, making them ideal for long listening sessions without causing discomfort. Additionally, the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) feature effectively blocks out external noises, allowing me to immerse myself in the music.

Audio Quality:
When it comes to audio quality, the AirPods Pro truly shine. The sound is incredibly crisp, with well-balanced mids, clear highs, and punchy bass. Whether I'm listening to classical symphonies or grooving to the latest hip-hop tracks, the AirPods Pro deliver an impressive audio experience that remains unparalleled in the true wireless earbud market.

Transparency Mode:
One standout feature that impressed me was the Transparency Mode. With a simple press, I could instantly switch from ANC to Transparency Mode, which allowed me to stay aware of my surroundings without removing the earbuds. This feature came in handy during outdoor activities, ensuring my safety while still enjoying my music.

Noise-Canceling:
The AirPods Pro's Active Noise Cancellation is hands down one of the best I've experienced. It effectively eliminates background noise, making them perfect for busy commutes or when I need to focus in a noisy environment. It significantly enhances the overall listening experience, helping me get lost in my favorite tunes without distractions.

Battery Life and Wireless Charging:
While the battery life of the AirPods Pro is not exceptionally long, it is adequate for most daily use. With ANC enabled, I consistently got around 4.5 to 5 hours of continuous playback, which is quite impressive considering the active noise-canceling feature. The wireless charging case is also a convenient addition, providing multiple charges on the go without the hassle of cables.

Connectivity and Controls:
Pairing the AirPods Pro with my Apple devices was seamless and hassle-free. Once paired, they automatically connect to the device whenever I open the case. The touch controls on the earbuds are responsive and intuitive, allowing me to control music playback, answer calls, and access Siri effortlessly.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the AirPods Pro is a top-of-the-line true wireless earbud offering from Apple that delivers outstanding audio quality, comfort, and cutting-edge features. From the moment I put them on, I was blown away by the immersive audio experience and the convenience they provided. If you are looking for the best wireless earbuds on the market, the AirPods Pro should undoubtedly be at the top of your list.

Apple MacBook Air Laptop,"‚ÄúI‚Äôve been using the MacBook M2 with 16GB RAM and 256GB storage for a while now, and it‚Äôs an absolute beast! üî•

Performance: The M2 chip is a game-changer. It handles everything I throw at it, from multitasking with heavy apps like Final Cut Pro and Photoshop to running virtual machines effortlessly. There‚Äôs zero lag, even with multiple tabs and applications open simultaneously.

Battery Life: The efficiency of the M2 chip paired with macOS is incredible. I easily get 10+ hours of battery life on a single charge, which makes it perfect for working on the go.

Build Quality: As expected from Apple, the build is premium. The sleek design, lightweight form factor, and stunning Retina display with vibrant colors make this laptop a joy to use every day.

Storage: While 256GB might seem limited for some, the speed of the SSD makes up for it. Apps launch instantly, and file transfers are blazing fast. For those who need more storage, external SSDs or cloud storage work seamlessly with the system.

Verdict: If you‚Äôre looking for a laptop that delivers on performance, portability, and battery life, the MacBook M2 is unbeatable in its class. Whether you‚Äôre a creative professional, a coder, or a student, this machine will not disappoint. Highly recommend!‚Äù

Apple Watch Series 9,Beautiful watch ‚ù§Ô∏è,Flipkart
Apple Watch Series 9,"This is the first time after much speculations and weighing all the other options I decided to buy an Apple Watch.
I‚Äôve been using it for last two months and it‚Äôs flawless.
It has every feature, and of course, using it with iPhone or iPad Makes it very easy to use .
The best part about the watch is it‚Äôs connectivity, gestures, of course.
It‚Äôs battery life is very good. I have to charge once in one and a half day and that‚Äôs all ,it last for long, given that it is connected with Wi-Fi whole time.
It charges very quickly.
When it comes to appearance, I ordered 41 MM, it comes with sports strap band which is really good quality, only if somebody wants a different strap then you can purchase separately otherwise, no need at all.
Separately, I ordered a protector and a screen guard.

If somebody is looking for new Apple Watch who has never used it, this money is worth, but I‚Äôve heard that people already have previous series watches then there is no point in upgrading. I‚Äôve heard that it is pretty much same but for new investment this is Best latest. 10 on 10.

Apple Watch Series 9,"Old but precise. That is how I would describe it. Old as in the packaging i got was quite dirty. But the product inside was fine and works very good.

Apple Watch Series 9,"Excellent watch with very good battery life. Apple watches get booted and paired very fast. UI is buttery smooth. Lack of direct WhatsApp App is a bit disappointing. Apart from that a must have watch for Apple users. Go for Silver as you can switch different colored bands with it :)

You need not to use mobile phone if you wear Apple Watch. My screen time got reduced, every time I need not to check my Phone for all the notifications.

Apple Watch Series 9,"The Apple Watch Series 9 emerges as a shining example of innovation and forward-thinking in the realm of smartwatches. With its brighter, more powerful screen and the introduction of the Double Tap gesture, it stands out as a significant leap forward in user interaction1. The new S9 chipset not only enhances performance but also paves the way for a more eco-friendly approach to technology.

One of the most talked-about features is the Double Tap gesture, which promises to revolutionize the way we interact with our devices on a daily basis1. It‚Äôs a delightful addition that enhances the overall user experience. Moreover, the watch‚Äôs commitment to sustainability is commendable, with its shift towards environmentally friendly materials and its status as the first carbon-neutral Apple device2.

While it maintains the classic design we‚Äôve come to love, the Series 9 doesn‚Äôt shy away from introducing new technologies such as the Ultra Wideband (UWB) radio technology. This not only improves device finding capabilities but also ensures that the watch is future-proof, ready to embrace upcoming features developed for UWB-capable devices1.

In conclusion, the Apple Watch Series 9 is not just a smartwatch; it‚Äôs a statement of where technology can take us when it‚Äôs designed with both the user and the environment in mind. It‚Äôs the perfect companion for those who want the best of Apple‚Äôs smartwatch capabilities, wrapped up in a device that‚Äôs both powerful and responsible.

"Apple iPhone 14 Plus (Blue, 128 GB)","About the phone
Apple phone without a second delay, I would say it is better than all android phones I have used. The phone is like water, it flows in a way you want and shaping in your way. In a best way possible, the phone is designed to only show what the user wants and eliminating unnecessary ads, features that I have seen in android.

Why it is better than Android?
You pay too much money for Apple products, obviously you experience the features, physical components , camera lens etc. Apart from basic things, you can also enjoy the best applications available in app store. If you are a developer you might know the app store policy for application publish and their security posture towards handling payment apps etc. They publish best application and the way the apps, its modules switches is just flawless. Due to the so called strict policy of privacy program with Apple products, iPhone can pop up a box in your screen if any apps wants to track your activity with other applications. +1 respect for apple to show such concern with user.

Apple phones are same ? like 13 vs 14
The reason 14 is same as 13 may be business practice followed from 11th edition. But please note that iPhone making changes internally like physical components (small change in battery performance, lens in 14 edition), additional features but that may not satisfy you to buy 14 edition. If you do not find ""the very few changes"" interesting in 14, go for 13. Because physical and even cameras are not visually very much different in 13 vs 14 comparison. Also you get 13 for cheap :)
14 is just added features but that is not for daily use, the features real time use is rare case. But the best part is there is no extra cost between 13 vs 14 prices (except extra 10k slash)

Concern you must have.
Apple is not giving chargers and their silicon cases are very expensive (but very good in touch and scratch friendly in back due to silk layer). This is an issue for sure. You have to buy charger not coming with USB C and claiming that you help carbon footprint, understandable but not customer friendly business model. Even after the purchase I had to spend at least 7k for charger and case.

Apple care.
I am not buying it, I pay for phone which is already expensive for this premium and apple care does have strict policy that if you understand that is waste. Instead I find a private insurance to make things better.

"Apple iPhone 16 (Black, 128 GB)","I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.
I received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.

After approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.

I contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.

I then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.

I am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.

Previously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.

I request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.

I hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.

Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max(256 GB),"Excellent phone, Apple Intelligence is amazing, the battery life is mind blowing and comes with the best camera. If you have a 13 Pro Max or older, go for it. If you have a 14 Pro Max, the only difference you are going to see is Apple Intelligence, better battery life and slightly better cameras. Otherwise it's going to feel like the exact same phone if you use it without a case as the rounded eges in 16 Pro Max are better to use without cases. Skip and save money if you have the 15 Pro Max because the difference is negligible. The black titanium color looks gorgeous and the only good color in the current series. It's a shame they removed the Blue Titanium color. Also costs 15-20k less than the launch price of 15 Pro Max so that is a huge plus.

Things I liked:
1. Speakers are amazing.
2. Battery life is good.
3. Overall smoothness.
4. Camera is great.

Things I did not like:
1. All the Web Browsers (Safari or others) are limited to 60hz.
2. No option for menu bar navigation (android has both gestures and bar).
3. Display / Screen color is fixed at Natural tone (no option for Vivid etc).
4. Restricted files/folder access and many other UI limitations.

Crompton Optimus 100 Litres Desert Air Cooler for home,"I recently purchased the Crompton Optimus Desert Air Cooler (65L) and I'm thoroughly impressed with both the product and the seller's service.

Product Review:
The cooler is well-built with high-quality plastic that feels durable. The honeycomb pads are highly effective, efficiently cooling the room without excessive noise. A standout feature is the ice chamber conveniently located at the top, which enhances the cooling effect.
Initially, I encountered a minor issue with water distribution to the honeycomb pads. However, this leads me to the most impressive part of my experience - the customer service.

Seller Service:
When I shared the issue during their follow-up for a review, the seller's reaction was swift and customer-focused. They immediately offered to replace the cooler, no questions asked. The next day, they sent someone to deliver a new unit and take back the faulty one.
This level of service went above and beyond my expectations. It was far more convenient than having to ship such a large item myself, which Amazon had initially suggested. The seller's proactive approach, quick resolution, and hassle-free replacement process were truly impressive.

I recommend both this cooler and this seller. The product is efficient and well-designed, and with this level of after-sales support, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. It's refreshing to see a company that stands behind their product and prioritizes customer satisfaction to this degree.

Crompton Optimus 100 Litres Desert Air Cooler for home,"Very good product crompton.
Air cooler size am not expect this much height .
It's very tall optimus 65 model.
It's suitable for big size hall ....
2 days am used this product ....
Cooling wise it's so wonderful am filling light hot water inside the chamber but output it's give cooling & breeze air .
First day approximately I filled 60-62 ltr water afternoon 1 to evening 8 o clock it's continuously running and comes under min level.

Second day filled 60 LTR water using at night time
9 pm to morning 5 am .
So average 8 hours it's running full tank capacity.

Noise wise quit good . Very pleasant .

First day full of honeycomb smell in hall .
But second day it's not in machine .
So smell so horrible at day 1 . So pls out of children from this cooler day 1.

Before operate & run the aircooler kindly check bottom chamber I identified two screw inside the water chamber.
I dont know how it's happened may be travelling time it may be happen .
So before check water chamber then you run it your cooler.

Note : Water issue area people & metro people
per day it's consump 60 ltr water so cost it around
25*3 water cane = 60 ruppes
60*30 days = 1800 rupees
+
Current bill consumption you add so total it around 2100 RS it's come monthly charge .
So my personal opinion
If you need aircooler for your home think & buy.
If water problem not in your area.
If water problem is there in your area kindly think and buy .

Thankyou

Crompton Optimus 100 Litres Desert Air Cooler for home,"Plastic Material Discrepancy:
Notably, the ice chamber and cover are constructed from noticeably different plastics, both in texture and color. The chamber boasts a sturdier feel, while the cover feels flimsy and is of a distinctly different hue. This inconsistency in material quality is concerning, particularly for a product of this nature.

Cover Fitment Issues:
The cover's inability to close properly is a recurring annoyance, requiring undue force to secure it in place. Furthermore, its bent appearance near the corners suggests a lack of precision in the manufacturing process, leading to frustration during use.

Mosquito Net Blockage: Examination reveals that portions of the mosquito netting are completely sealed off, raising doubts about the effectiveness of ventilation. Such blockages could impede airflow to the honeycomb pad, potentially compromising the unit's cooling capabilities and placing undue strain on the fan mechanism.

Body Gaps:
Upon closer inspection, it becomes evident that there are multiple areas where the various components of the body fail to align seamlessly. These visible gaps suggest a lack of attention to detail during assembly, detracting from the product's overall aesthetic and functionality.

GoPro Hero13 Special Bundle Sports and Action Camera,"When I first powered the device on, it needed an update before I could use it. Once updated the camera was ready to go. The picture and video quality from this little camera is very impressive. Camera offers a lot of options that you can customize from resolution to frame rates as well as other options for compression ratio which is phenomenal for camera this size. Battery life is very less and at 4K60, you can record for around 70-75 minutes and at 5.3k/60fps you will be able to record 40-45 minutes max. On test videos taken using my scooter, I was impressed by HyperSmooth stabilization that provided smooth footage.

Pros :
1. Recording in log format is awesome for people who are into color grading.
2. Picture quality during day time is awesome.
3. The best stabilization in its segment.

Cons :
1. When shooting in 5.3k/60fps the battery dies within 40-50 minutes.
2. Video quality during night time is not up to the mark.
3. Another peeve is that you need to keep the battery cover open to charge, which exposes both the battery and memory card to the elements. I don‚Äôt know why they can‚Äôt have a separate cover for USB port or a weather-sealed one but having to open the cover every time I needed to charge got old. They should include the USB cover or better yet, the magneto cover that I ended up buying as the standard cover on these things.
4. Gets smoking hot when using the camera in environments without airflow. When I'm using it for POV shots while driving motorcycle it does not get hot and keeps recording for longer durations(Recorded 1 hour video when driving motorcycle). But, when I use it for making indoor videos or maybe making video of a car, it gets so hot that it shuts down automatically within 10-15 minutes. So those who are buying it for motovlogging are ok, but people who may use it for normal vlogging may face this overheating issue.

LG 322 L 3 Star Frost-Free Smart Inverter Double Door Refrigerator,"Exchange facility
Amazon exchange facility is much better than Flipkart. For the same old fridge (which was 17 yrs old but in good working condition), Flipkart refused to accept saying there are a few (minor) rust marks at bottom of door whereas Amazon accepted without any fuss.

Price
After researching on various 335ltr models, decided on this one due to features and price. Bought on 24-Oct-20 for a effective price of INR 27,500 after exchange, discounts and card cashback.

Delivery & Installation
The new fridge was delivered in good condition without any scratch or damage. Since I was without a fridge when the new one was delivered at 12pm (old taken away in exchange), the LG technician accepted my request to come the same day (at 4pm) and install the new one. I am thankful for this excellent gesture on his part.

Pros
The fridge area is spacious and feels bigger than the earlier LG 390 ltrs model which I was using. This is becos of the more shelves in this model. The pull out tray and the convertible box (above the veg bin) are very useful. The cooling at mid settings is good. The external look in very elegant. The build quality is very good and the fridge has sturdy look overall.

Cons
The vegetable / fruit storage bin at the bottom seems constricted in size and does not move freely. The inside area of freezer compartment also seems smaller as compared to the view from outside. The ice trays / storage occupy much space. No light in the freezer - not sure why LG does not install (even my 17 yr old did not have) inspite of its usefulness and every review mentioning this as a drawback. The user manual is very basic and does not explain the high / low feature in the convertible box / veg bin.

Overall
Though the cons look more, they are not so significant as compared to the good features. I am satisfied with this model and will recommend it.

But Amazon apps says two people will come to deliver. Before signing any contract, Amazon have to do background check up, Now a days every company doing background check up, for a small small postions. I think this company don‚Äôt even have an application where the agent can send a pic of the Customer building, so that it confirms he or she visited the customer location, they gave another option like contact was made but unable to reach customer, wooooow amazing, if he made a contact to the customer, this company app should witness the customer number, in this way should confirm, because of I‚Äôm staying in 2nd floor, they don‚Äôt want to deliver on the floor, then why Amazon accepting the order, if they are charging for the 2nd, 1st floor separately, we are ok to pay but this a wooooorst company where only one person delivering the refrigerator. What if the senior citizens staying on 2nd floor.
After reading this review people will think that , it‚Äôs not a company mistake, it‚Äôs mistake of agents.
Woooooooow
Keeping this I have asked few questions with agents he said, company only saying that not to deliver the product on the 2nd floor separately, deliver on ground floor, it doesn‚Äôt matter where they are staying.
From this I understood, company thinking about money not about growing in the future.
So, Amazon has open their eyes, think once again to do business with this wooooorst company.

3. Rotate to extend kajal lead prevents wastage as is the case with wooden kajal pencil where you need to sharpen it. Lots of kajal is wasted with the sharpener.
4. One pencil may last for months based on moderate usage.
5. Dual pencil pack with extra savings.
6. Kajal is waterproof & safe for eyes.

Again, as i always say. Be proactive and research well before ordering from any seller to avoid the issues. Check seller ratings, Amazon fulfilled tag, etc. Not every seller here is there to dupe you. They too source material from retailers and wholesalers.

And if you are unfortunate, contact Amazon with your issue. Its mentioned on the website ""This item isn't eligible for return. However, if you've received a damaged, defective, or different item, you may contact us for the next steps.""
But since this product is directly non-returnable due to its nature, be proactive and avoid troubles in the first place.

One thing that may help everyone is to make a video while opening any item received. This will act as proof (in case there's an issue) that it was sent to you that way while making a request to the care person. A minute video can save you troubles later on.

‚ñ∂ In my case pencil was intact with no damage to kajal lead or outer casing. Also, it's the same as the one sourced from the local shop. I have attached genuine hologram pics to compare. The fake ones have a different hologram.

1. Small lettered LAKME written all over horizontally.
2. Central region had the 3D effect of a hemisphere with LAKME written on top and bigger font EYE CO NIC written in 3 separate lines.
3. A big L visible in the central region surrounding hemisphere.
4. Pacman type figure covering two sides of L in point 3.
5. The hologram is under lamination and so is not removable.

If you don't find the above characteristics, don't even open it from the back and contact Amazon.

‚ñ∂ A genuine hologram is authentic because its exact design is not at all easily reproducible. One needs the costly master die to reproduce the hologram while hologram manufacturers do not manufacture any brand-specific die or hologram without sufficient documentation authenticating the ownership of the brand name.

OnePlus 13,"Oneplus has outdone themselves with this phone!

The phone is best in all categories.
I'm loving it's stunning display, it's superb Camera which compares and performs better than the iphone 15 pro Max (have compared and the iphone user agrees!), the super powerful battery and the INSANE battery life! (check the attached image). It also gets charged super duper fast! Takes about 30-35 minutes to go from 10-100% and then I hardly ever seen the need to charge it in the next 1-1.5 days. At best cases, it even lasts whole 2 days+

It also has a really premium feeling. I got the beautiful white one, 16+512gb variant.

The Oxygen OS 15 is really fluid and butter smooth. Feels very refined. Speakers are great for audio output in rooms (hall, bedroom etc)

Honestly, coming from OP6 (which itself was a legandary) after ~6.5+ years, THIS IS THE UPGRADE I could ever ask for!

Oh and the AI photo editor works like charm. So does the circle to search. Haven't had chance to test other features yet but I feel like the device will really live upto the feeling so far.

Amazing work Oneplus!

Back to The OnePlus ,10 Years of love - OP1,OP6T,OP9PRO & NOW ONEPLUS 13

Key Points:-

A) Pro's

1) Battery Backup ( see screenshot )
2) Very Smooth UI ( look and feel of ios - 60-70%)
3) 8 Elite is just awesome ( Superfast )
4) There is no heating observed, atleast by me
5) Charging Speed. ( 38-40 min for full charge )
6) Haptic Feedbacks ( Just Awesome )
7) Good AI features ( AI eraser,AI unblur )
8) Lifetime green line warrenty.

B) Cons

1) Camera - Not upto the Mark
2) Laggy Zoom ( camera ) while switching lences ( not even close to the iphone, iPhone is the best for smooth camera zoom/lence switching )
3) Sound Quality - just feeling like I'm using 15-20k device, in past OnePlus given dolby atmos for their devices until OnePlus 12 ,but now they are giving OReality audio ( which is too bad )
compared with iPhone15, our OnePlus is far away from the compitition.
4) Notification delay for instagram.( can be fixed )
5) Build quality not feels Premium.
6) Price Tag - it should be available for 50k to 60k

Redmi Note 12 Pro,"The Redmi 12 5G comes with a decent set of features at an affordable price, but it has some drawbacks, particularly in heating and battery performance.

Pros:

‚úÖ Display: The 6.79-inch FHD+ display with a 120Hz refresh rate provides a smooth and immersive experience for gaming and media consumption.
‚úÖ Performance: The Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 processor handles daily tasks well and supports 5G connectivity.
‚úÖ Design: The phone has a premium glass back design, which is rare in this price segment.
‚úÖ Camera: The 50MP primary camera captures decent shots in good lighting conditions.
‚úÖ Software: MIUI 14 based on Android 13 offers a feature-rich experience.

Cons:

‚ùå Heating Issues: The device tends to heat up during gaming, video recording, or extended usage, making it uncomfortable to hold.
‚ùå Battery Performance: The 5000mAh battery should last longer, but due to software optimizations (or lack of them) and heating issues, the battery drains faster than expected. Heavy users may need to charge twice a day.
‚ùå Bloatware: MIUI comes with pre-installed apps, some of which cannot be removed easily.

Verdict:

The Redmi 12 5G is a good option if you need a budget-friendly 5G smartphone with a solid display and decent performance. However, the heating problem and fast battery drain could be deal-breakers for power users

As in description it does not have memory card slot. So we cannot add or increase storage space. Camera is very poor. Also in night also camera quality is less compared to redmi note 11 pro 5g. In redmi note 11 pro 5g they can increase storage by using memory card slot. Battery charge capacity is weak. On charging mobile becomes hot so that we assume it will burst. Main thing is on auto brightness the mobile becomes so dark so that no one can view correctly. So changing manual brightness to max is the only option.
One good thing is that while capturing videos steadiness is always there.
Conclusion.
Battery very weak
Camera not upto mark. Below average
No memory slot available
Side Finger print is not working after several attempts. So we have to draw pattern or type password again and again to open.

Redmi Note 13 Pro,"I've been using the Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus for a week now, and I must say, it's exceeded my expectations in almost every department! The phone's performance is lightning-fast, thanks to the powerful processor and ample RAM. The display is stunning, with vibrant colors and crisp visuals. Battery life is impressive, easily lasting a day with heavy usage. Cameras are top-notch, capturing detailed photos and videos. The design is sleek and premium, with a comfortable grip. Call quality is top notch, even in low network areas.
Cons: software and security update as given are for 03 years and 04 years respectively, they could have offered for more like for 05 years, though the phone came with Hyper OS and Android 14 out of th the box, comparing to the initial phone which came with MIUI 14 and Android 13. It will be a long wait to see how many updates i will be getting.
Other only minor gripe is the lack of wireless charging, but that's a small trade-off for the incredible value this phone offers. Overall, I'm thoroughly enjoying my Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus experience and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a high-performance device without breaking the bank. My review - A premium package on a mid range budget.

Redmi Note 13 Pro,Best Phone Ever I Love It..... Awesome üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç,Flipkart
Redmi Note 13 Pro,"I've been using the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ for a while now, and I have to say, it's an amazing phone, especially for the price. Here‚Äôs why I love it:

Design and Feel:
First off, it looks and feels premium. The sleek design and solid build make it feel way more expensive than it actually is. It's comfortable to hold and use, which is a big plus.

Display:
The screen is gorgeous. The AMOLED display is bright and vibrant, making everything from videos to games look fantastic. Plus, the high refresh rate makes scrolling and animations super smooth.

Performance:
Even though it has a weaker processor compared to other upper mid-range smartphones, the performance is still really good. Apps open quickly, and multitasking is a breeze. I‚Äôve played some pretty graphics-heavy games on it, and it handles them surprisingly well.

Camera:
The camera setup is really impressive. Photos come out clear and vibrant, even in low light. The extra lenses for wide-angle shots and close-ups add a lot of versatility. It‚Äôs perfect for snapping great photos on the go.

Battery Life:
Battery life is solid. It easily lasts all day with heavy use, and the fast charging is a lifesaver when you‚Äôre in a hurry. No more waiting around for your phone to charge!

Software:
HyperOs is smooth and feature-packed. It takes a bit to get used to if you‚Äôre coming from another brand, but it‚Äôs intuitive and has a lot of useful features.

Overall, the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ is a fantastic choice if you want a high-quality phone without spending a fortune. It delivers great performance, a beautiful display, and a top-notch camera all at an affordable price. Definitely recommend it!

Bonus: There's no heating issue observed when doing demanding tasks!

Redmi Note 13 Pro,This device is so good but the major problem is camera sum time working well sum time giving over exposed image quality redmi please give camera update and fix this problem,Flipkart
Redmi Note 13 Pro,"First of all let's go with the pros
Display: the best thing I liked about this device is it's display am first time using an amoled curved display and it's soo good it's super smooth with 120hz and the colors are good too and within a week this device fall from about 6 feet and 3-4 times and there was not even a scratch it shows the victus protection does it's job well
‚Ä¢ some of the users claim that the 120 watts is not working it's taking about 50 mins but actually if you try to charge the device out of the box it will shows that 120w quick charge but you need to go to settings>battery and switch on the boost charging then only it gives you true 120w potential in 19 mins
‚Ä¢ I had test the device dipped in water for 15 mins and still there is no issues found so the ip68 also works good
‚Ä¢ And i got and update from miui to xiaomi hyperos
And the ui is also super smooth without any bugs found
‚Ä¢ and about gaming the device gives a smooth experience I played freefire in max settings in high fps and still I got about 50fps and i tried e-football ect.. And the device heats up a bit still not overheating in gaming I didn't found any shutters or lags it works smooth
Cons:
I think this stuff is a bit overpriced
The camera is not up to the mark in these price range
But still it can be fixed with a software update
And the battery drains fast I don't think it's 5000 mah my 5 yrs old vivo gives more backup than this but still 120w just full in 19 mins
And the other features are good about these device the cons can be just fixed by an update and after all i love these phone don't mind the negative comments just go for it and i have a suggestion it's bit over priced so you can buy it on offer times and it's not an performance oriented device if you are a gamer or looking that types of phne you can go for iqoo neo 9 Or something and that's all about these device I think this review may help you and i I'll update if I faced any prblms thank youüòä

They will give you same model but built quality and RAM and ROM will be more updated version. Also remember if you think online and offline products are same then you are wrong.

Samsung 80 cm (32 inches) HD Ready Smart LED TV UA32T4380AKXXL (Glossy Black),"NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product.

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Smartphone,"Samsung has been on the epitome in smartphone market since very long and it is clearly seen in the quality of this product.
Battery stays for the day with moderate usage. Only Superfast charging (25W) is supported and not Superfast 2.0 (45W) like S24 Ultra series.

Camera preview on the rear screen is the most used feature by me and because of Nice Camera Quality, it outshines other phones in this range.

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Smartphone,"I have been using various samsung fones from Note series to S series to humble M or A. My son is apple guy and has latest Phone. BUT fold6 is THE BEST! It's a beast! Seriously! The only cons is camera quality that should have been better, but otherwise this is superb! The processing, speed, split screen, editing. AI...the list is endless. Plus the admiration and attention otherwise gets in large screen is worth the money! Btw, there is gst added to interest for emi option that makes the fone a lot more expensive then the emi mentioned. Unfortunately that is not clearly mentioned while purchasing.

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Smartphone,"I bought this phone just a month ago for my wife. She was so cautious that she did not even want to use it before we got a Cover for it. She uses her phone for both personal and office related work. It was working fine for the first 2-3 weeks, but since a week she started complaining that the screen is freezing. It does not respond at all. This kept repeating again and again at least 15-20 times a day over the last couple of days. We tried multiple things like waiting for a little while, clearing the cache, closing all apps and finally hard booting if required. But today morning, the screen did not respond even after hard booting. We are able to use the limited features that are accessible on the small screen on the top, but the main screen did not work. we finally took it to the authorized service center and to our surprise, they could not replicate the problem there. The moment we left that place and came home, the same problem re-started again. We had to go back to the service center and they said they'll have to reinstall the OS to fix the issue. I hope they'll be able to fix it for good before returning it to us.

However, my concern is that a phone that costs ~1.2 Lakhs crashing like this within a month of buying it, is completely unacceptable. We do not have any 3rd party apps installed, no physical damage or any other things that we can think of that could cause this kind of an issue. I have been a loyal Android user and Samsung is supposed to be producing the best of the Android devices in the market. I am absolutely disappointed by this experience.

Update: At the Service center, they diagnosed that it was a hardware issue and had to replace the touchscreen. For some reason they also replaced the battery. I still don't understand what the battery had to do with the touch screen not working. I hope the issue is fixed for good now. Nevertheless. I am really disappointed with this incident. I feel like we are using a refurbished phone and not a new one though we paid for a new one!

Performance-wise, this phone is a beast. Multitasking is a breeze, and apps open instantly, thanks to the top-tier processor. Battery life is also fantastic, easily lasting me a full day with heavy use, and fast charging means I‚Äôm never stuck waiting long when I need a boost.

The camera quality is next-level! Low-light photos come out crisp, the zoom is mind-blowing, and colors are captured beautifully. It‚Äôs like having a professional camera in my pocket.

Overall, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is worth every penny. It‚Äôs a true flagship device that feels future-proof, and I‚Äôd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a powerful, feature-packed smartphone!

Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones,"4 star rating just for bad packing from seller as there are no packing material on the box. seller slapped bill on original box. for such premium device it is disappointing.
Build and design: I had used these headphones for more than week and I would say device is very comfortable for longer use ( watching movies) , quite light weight , controls are easy to use, touch response is fast with almost no delay.
Audio: Well I am not used to over the ears devices so I cant compare to others but its great overall. bit bassy for my liking and little less bright u can say but it can be easily fixed by eq. so no problems there ( may be brand had tuned it for more neutral profile) .After eq tuning these are mostly excellent for songs , movies podcast etc.
also audio quality depends upon you device too. as I tested it on low end mobile and high end devices, u can observe difference.
noise cancellation: I bought these for work at home , typically coding, study research papers , as people can get really vocal and for analysing complex articles you need silence. As per all reviews these are one of the best but you need to keep your expectation realistic. You can easily hear person talking at moderate volume in same room( reduce by a bit ) or even to next room if someone it talking loud or moderately loud.
But if in next room people are talking a moderately low volume you wont hear them same is for tv, at high volume you will definitly hear it.( you can play some white noise or music than you minimise other noise.)
what more to consider: These cut other background noise like of ac ( almost completely ) , birds, other typical noises. It can get little uncomfortable( unnatural silence üòÇ) for some in begining. you also hear people because it cut other backgroud noise so much that even little things are more highlighted.
for other: If you are buying these for listening music and watching movies while travel It will cut every thing while playing music or movies. Maybe these are designed for this purpose.
Pass though mode: As per my opinion its great , almost natural with no delay,
Battery I didnt tested extensively that how much time it can go but I feel more than sufficient easily last for couple of days if using 5-6 hours a day, charging is also fast so no worries there.
Biggest bummer for me. Its no surprise that there is no dolby atmos support. I think for this price it should be there, As sony 360 audio is not supported at all platforms n very less content is available. so for spatial audio doby should had been there. I had used other product with dolby it makes huge impact.

Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones,"I had been an AirPods Pro user and was always of the belief that they have the best music reproduction with lossless audio from apps like Apple Music. Was seriously wanting to try the XMs when the XM4 was launched but wasn‚Äôt happy with the reviews of mic quality as I generally take calls for more than 7 hours on my work days. But when XM5s came in was tempted to try them after the reviews paying more details on the improved mic quality. I wanted to give it a try and tried the music when I was in France in a store, but the sound quality was very poor since the store let me use it only with their wired audio source and said NO to try with my phone. Back in India I tried again once in a store using my phone and Apple Music and Boy o Boy I was proved wrong!!! I was simply blown over on how the headphones were clear with the Spatial Audio even with the default EQ setting. I‚Äôm not a bass heavy person but rather love the different tones and this is a Pro quality one in that. With the ANC microphones it was even a blessing that the call trials(both with MS Teams and Phone) I did were fantastic. Decided to grab this and ordered in Amazon when it was available for around 28K net with cashback and I would say this is the best investment I had made. The dual connectivity, monstrous battery back up, ANC combined with the best mic makes it a great headphone one can ever have. The size and case as most say as negative isn‚Äôt a problem at all. The build also is good and this is a keeper. If you are not worried about the budget and need a headphone that u can use for both work(calls) and music blindly go for this.. üëçüèª

Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones,"These are the best headphones from Sony. Previously I used Sony headphones but they're entry-level headphones. I also used headphones from other brands like Sennheiser, One Audio and JBL but all of them are entry-level headphones. This is the first time I bought high-end headphones and I trust Sony. You can't go wrong with Sony as per my experience. Coming to the headphones, I already knew that these were best. However, I researched thoroughly on YouTube and read many articles for almost 3 months before buying these. I want to get the best value for the price. These headphones are costly and I don't want to go wrong with my purchase decision.

Build quality: These are made of high-quality plastic and feel lightweight and comfortable to wear for longer durations. The only thing is, that the headband is thin and hurts a little on my head after wearing it for a few hours. Just move or adjust it a little and I'm good to go for another hour.

Sound quality: It's Sony, no need to brag about sound quality. Sony is known for sound clarity. Every small musical instrument is heard in great detail. I can't forget my first experience of listening to music using these headphones. I'm blown away by the details and the clarity of sound.

Battery life: It is mentioned 30 hours. Seems to be true. Headphones will easily last up to two days of mixed usage.

Noise cancellation (N.C.): These headphones are my first experience with noise cancellation. When NC is turned on, it is silent. Zero noise. But after a few days, I realised that I could still hear voices from other people when they were shouting or talking loudly. It's good not to completely block all sound.

Update on N.C.:
I want to address one thing people who are saying that NC is not good. I think they feel like that because of the adaptive NC feature in the Sony headphones app. Due to this feature, the level of Noise cancelling is adjusted automatically according to the surroundings. I know it doesn't work 100% accurately every time. It works sort of 70 - 80 % accurately depending on the surroundings. That's why some people complain that NC is not completely silent or perfect. Some are complaining there is no option to disable the adaptive NC feature. It is available in the Sony headphones app after the latest update. We can also manually disable the adaptive NC of headphones using the app. I mentioned these details because some people may not be aware of these features available in the headphones app.

Note: When NC is turned on, a sound pressure is created between ears and headphones. So there is a vacuum-like seal between ears and headphones and it blocks external sound. I'm not sure how NC works. This is the first time for me experienced noise cancellation. It was a shock and a surprise feeling when NC was on. My brother got scared due to this effect. I got used to it now. Check the Sony manual regarding the safety of NC. In the Sony Headphones Connect app, there is a safe listening setting. Please follow it and you don't need to worry about your ears getting damaged due to headphones. I have attached screenshots of the same. Please check.

Final Verdict: I can say that these headphones are the best consumer headphones. Audiophile headphones are different that's why I mentioned them as the best consumer headphones. Most people who use them will love them.
